# TrackerApp
Assignment - Create an app that tracks user location. The app should have an enable tracking switch button. When tracking is enabled users' location should be tracked even the app goes in the background. Tracked location coordinates should be stored in a web database like firebase. When disabled all tracking activity except pending uploads should be terminated immediately. It should work on the latest Android versions without any issues.
